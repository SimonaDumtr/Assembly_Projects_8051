# Embedded Programming with C8051F040 Microcontroller
This repository contains two assembly projects developed for the Silicon Labs C8051F040 microcontroller. Both programs are written in low-level Assembly and demonstrate direct register manipulation, peripheral initialization, and digital control via GPIO and UART interfaces.

# Project 1: LED Bar Controller with ADC
This program reads an analog input using ADC2 and lights up a corresponding number of LEDs on a bar (connected to Ports 2 and 3). It includes watchdog timer setup, I/O configuration, voltage reference and ADC2 initialization.

# Features:
- 10 LEDs controlled individually (LED1 to LED10)
- Uses ADC2 to convert analog input
- LED bar visualizes the intensity level
- Fully interrupt-based and efficient looped execution

# Project 2: UART Character Sequence Transmitter
This program receives a character via UART1, verifies that it falls in a specific ASCII range (`A-Z`), and transmits a sequence of characters back. It also includes error handling (flashes `?` character).

# Features:
- UART1 communication via polling
- Character validation
- Response with incremental character sequence
- Error handling and looped execution
